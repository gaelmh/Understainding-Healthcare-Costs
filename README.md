# Understainding Healthcare Costs
This project analyzes the Medical Costs Personal Dataset from Kaggle to understand the impact of demographic and lifestyle factors on healthcare costs. It employs generalized linear modeling techniques, including linear regression, logistic regression, and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), to explore these relationships.
- Linear Regression Analysis: To determine the relationship between medical costs and factors such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoker status, and region.
- Logistic Regression: To predict whether medical costs will be higher or lower than $9,500 based on the other variables.
- ANOVA: To investigate variations in medical costs considering categorical variables like "Sex," "Smoker," and "Region".
