# Understainding Healthcare Costs
Through generalized linear models, this project investigates healthcare data to analyze the impact of demographic and lifestyle factors on healthcare costs.

## Data:
[Healthcare Costs]([link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance))

## Models:
- **Linear Regression Analysis:** To determine the relationship between medical costs and factors such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoker status, and region.
- **Logistic Regression:** To predict whether medical costs will be higher or lower than $9,500 based on the other variables.
- **ANOVA:** To investigate variations in medical costs considering categorical variables like "Sex," "Smoker," and "Region".

## Key Insights:
-	**Smoking's Dominant Impact (Linear Regression & ANOVA):** Being a smoker significantly increases medical charges, with smokers incurring, on average, $23,614 more in medical costs compared to non-smokers.
-	**Age and Region Influence (Logistic Regression):** Age and region are statistically significant predictors for whether medical costs will be higher than $9,500.

## Key Technologies:
**Language:** R
**Libraries:** 
- dplyr (data manipulation)
- lm (Linear Regression)
- glm (Logistic Regression)
- aov (ANOVA)
- ggplot2 (data visualization)
